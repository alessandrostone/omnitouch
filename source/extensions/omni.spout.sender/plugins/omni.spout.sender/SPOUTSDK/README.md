- [Spout for OpenGL](https://spoutgl-site.netlify.app/)
- [SpoutLibrary - C compatible library](https://spoutlibrary-site.netlify.app/)
- [Spout for DirectX](https://spoutdx-site.netlify.app/)

The SpoutGL folder contains the Spout SDK source files for OpenGL.\
The SpoutDirectX folder contains source files for SpoutDX, SpoutDX9 and SpoutDX12 classes.

## Libraries

Project libraries for OpenGL, DirectX11, DirectX12 and DirectX9 can be generated by CMake.\
Refer to "Building the libraries.pdf" in the root folder.\
After build with CMake, binaries can be found in the BUILD/Binaries folder.

- [SpoutLibrary](https://spoutlibrary-site.netlify.app/)

The Spout SDK as a C-compatible dll that can be used with compilers other than Visual Studio.

- [SpoutDirectX](https://spoutdx-site.netlify.app/)

A sub-set of the Spout SDK for applications using DirectX rather than OpenGL.\
SpoutDX is a support class for that provides functions similar to those in the OpenGL version of the SDK.\
SpoutDX was originally designed for D3D11 and has been extended for D3D12 and D3D9 with very similar methods.\
Several examples show details of use. 

- ARM build

The Spout library can be built for [Windows on ARM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/overview) for devices powered by Arm processors using DirectX 11, DirectX 12 and OpenGL, if the CMake "SPOUT_BUILD_ARM" option is selected. For x86 processors, the option has no effect and does not need to be selected.\
[sse2neon.h](https://github.com/DLTcollab/sse2neon) is a C/C++ header file that translates Intel SSE intrinsics to [Arm NEON](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Neon) and is downloaded by CMake. The MIT licence for sse2neon.h is compatible with the Spout BSD licence, subject to the requirements outlined in the file source.\
Note that Spout is designed for Windows and will not operate with Linux.\
ARM build has been tested with Visual Studio and no support can not be offered for other compilers.

## OpenGL examples

OpenGL examples are available for Windows, Openframeworks and Cinder.\
Refer to "readme.md" in the "Examples" folder.

## DirectX examples

Examples are available for DirectX11, DirectX12 and DirectX9.\
Refer to "readme.md" in the "SpoutDirectX" folder.
