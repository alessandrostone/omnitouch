### Sharing DirectX textures without using OpenGL.

To build using source files, the following files of the Spout SDK are required :

    SpoutCommon.h
    SpoutCopy.cpp
    SpoutCopy.h
    SpoutDirectX.cpp
    SpoutDirectX.h
    SpoutFrameCount.cpp
    SpoutFrameCount.h
    SpoutSenderNames.cpp
    SpoutSenderNames.h
    SpoutSharedMemory.cpp
    SpoutSharedMemory.h
    SpoutUtils.cpp
    SpoutUtils.h  

For the SpoutDX class, the following additional files are required :

    SpoutDX.h
    SpoutDX.cpp


### Examples

DirectX 11 examples are based on D3D11 tutorials by Chuck Walbourn.\
https://github.com/walbourn/directx-sdk-samples/tree/master/Direct3D11Tutorials
- Tutorial04 - sender
- Tutorial07 - receiver

There are two versions for each example, contained separately in the following folders :

- Basic\
Stand-alone versions using methods directly from the Spout SDK classes as above. These give details on how the sender shared texture access and copy is managed.
	* Tutorial04 - sender
	* Tutorial07 - receiver
	
- SpoutDX\
Versions using the "SpoutDX" support class which contains the detail and presents simple functions for the application. The different versions have separate projects for Visual Studio 2017 and can be built independently.
	* Tutorial04 - sender
	* Tutorial07 - receiver
- Windows examples\
Based on a simple Windows Desktop Application project generated by Visual Studio and adapted to use the SpoutDX support class. These examples demonstrate SendImage and ReceiveImage to transfer image pixels to and from shared DirectX textures. They are unique in that no DirectX functions are used by the applications themselves but rather managed entirely by the SpoutDX class.
    * Sender
    * Receiver

The example project files are created for Visual Studio 2022. To build them, retain the folder structure of the Spout distribution. The Spout SDK files should be in a folder "SpoutGL" as follows :

      SpoutGL <- this folder has all the Spout SDK source files in it for OpenGL. 
	  SpoutDirectX <- this folder is for examples and the SpoutDX support class
	      Basic <- basic DirectX 11 tutorial examples
	          Tutorial04 <- DirectX 11 texture sender
	          Tutorial07 <- DirectX 11 texture receiver
	      SpoutDX <- Support class for DirectX 11
			  SpoutDX.cpp
			  SpoutDX.h
	          Tutorial04 <- DirectX texture sender
	          Tutorial07 <- DirectX texture receiver
              Windows <- Windows examples
			      Sender   <- Image sender
			      Receiver <- Image receiver
		  SpoutDX9 <- Support class for DirectX 9
			  SpoutDX9.cpp
			  SpoutDX9.h
	          D3D9_Vertices_Sender   <- DirectX 9 texture sender
	          D3D9_Vertices_Receiver <- DirectX 9 texture receiver
			  readme.md
		  SpoutDX12 <- Support class for DirectX 12
			  SpoutDX12.cpp
			  SpoutDX12.h
	          D3D12TriangleSender  <- DirectX 12 texture sender
	          D3D12TextureReceiver <- DirectX 12 texture receiver
			  readme.md

All the examples can be built with Visual Studio 2022 using "Example.sln". Change to release and "Build > Build Solution". All the example executables can then be found in "Binaries\Examples".

Individual projects can be built and selected as the startup project. Each example folder also has its own Visual Studio solution file and can be built independently.

For all examples, search for "SPOUT" to see the changes made to the original code. Refer to SpoutDX.pdf for further information.

### SpoutDX dynamic link library or static library

A sender example "Tutorial04_Lib" shows how to use SpoutDX as a library rather than source files. A "readme" file in the example folder and the source code provide more detail. 

The library files required are included with the project. For other applications, the SpoutDX library can be generated by CMake as detailed below.

### Other projects

The path for header files required for SpoutDX is established in SpoutDX.h.
If these files are in the same folder as SpoutDX.h, no action is necessary. 
If they are in different folders, a prefix is required. The default prefix
"..\..\SpoutGL\" assumes the repository folder structure and should be changed as required.
SpoutDX12.h or SpoutDX9.h should aslo be modified if they are used.

### Using CMake

Project files can be generated to build SpoutDX as a dll or static library, and also the the examples, using different Visual Studio compilers, or compilers other than Visual Studio. After build of the INSTALL project, SpoutDX files can be found in the INSTALL directory :

- bin - SpoutDX.dll (dynamic link library)
- lib - SpoutDX.lib (link library for the dll) SpoutDX_static.lib (static link library)
- include/SpoutDX - required header files

SpoutDX.h should be edited to change include paths to match with the application folders as described above.

Refer to "Building the libraries.pdf" at the root of the repository for more details.
