## OpenGL examples

### Windows

Windows examples are based on a basic application generated by Visual Studio using the Win32 API. They do not depend on any OpenGL framework and can be built independently.

### Openframeworks

Openframeworks examples demonstrate OpenGL fbo, texture and image send/receive and also the many options available. Openframeworks is required and files must be copied to the correct location before build. Refer to "Openframeworks\readme.md" for setup and build instructions.

### Cinder

For Cinder, refer to "readme-first.md" in the "Cinder\FboBasic" folder.
